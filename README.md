# DBScan_P2
-This is the second Part of the DBScan project using the DBScan algorithm (first part only used lists whereas the second part also implements
the DBScan algorithm using the KDTree ADT (Binary Search Tree) in order to improve efficiency)
-The program reads a csv file filled with arbitrary 3D-point (it stores the points in either a List or KDTree) and then finds arbitrary shaped clusters and clusters with noise
